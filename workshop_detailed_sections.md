# WORKSHOP DETAILED SECTIONS - PROPOSAL DEVELOPMENT GUIDE

## Section 1: Requirements Analysis & Problem Definition (15 ph√∫t)

### **üìã Learning Objective**
H·ªçc c√°ch thu th·∫≠p v√† document business requirements t·ª´ stakeholders ƒë·ªÉ build compelling business case.

### **1.1 Stakeholder Interview Simulation (5 ph√∫t)**

**üì∏ IMAGE NEEDED: Stakeholder Personas**
*Ch·ª•p slide v·ªõi 3 persona cards showing CTO, Operations Manager, CFO v·ªõi their key concerns*

#### **Setup Role-play Exercise:**
```markdown
Instructor Setup:
1. Chia nh√≥m th√†nh 3 teams: Business Analysts, Stakeholders, Observers
2. Provide stakeholder persona cards
3. Set timer cho m·ªói interview session (1.5 ph√∫t each)
4. Record key requirements on whiteboard
```

#### **CTO Interview Script:**
```
CTO: "Our current deployment process is a nightmare. We have 4 microservices:
- Authentication service (critical, must deploy first)
- Order processing service (depends on auth)  
- Payment service (depends on order)
- Notification service (can run independently)

The manual coordination takes 3-4 hours and we often have failures.
I need a solution that can handle dependencies automatically v√† provide
rollback capability trong 2 minutes if something goes wrong."

Questions to ask:
- What's the current failure rate?
- How often do you deploy?
- What's the impact of deployment downtime?
- What compliance requirements do we have?
```

#### **Operations Manager Interview Script:**
```
Ops Manager: "Every deployment requires 2-3 people working overtime,
usually on weekends. We have to manually coordinate:
- Database migrations
- Service startup sequences  
- Health checks
- Load balancer configuration

The process is error-prone v√† stressful. Last month we had 3 major
incidents during deployments that affected customer orders."

Questions to ask:
- How many people involved in current process?
- What's the cost of deployment windows?
- What monitoring tools do you currently use?
- What training would your team need?
```

#### **CFO Interview Script:**
```
CFO: "Show me numbers. Current deployments cost us:
- Developer overtime: $2,000 per deployment
- Weekend premium pay: $1,500 per deployment  
- Lost revenue during downtime: $5,000 per incident
- Customer service complaints: $500 per incident

We deploy 26 times per year. I need to see clear ROI
within 12 months v√† operational cost reduction."

Questions to ask:
- What's the budget range for this project?
- What ROI percentage would be acceptable?
- Are there compliance costs to consider?
- How do you measure business impact?
```

### **5.2 Compelling Narrative Development (12 ph√∫t)**

**üì∏ IMAGE NEEDED: Storytelling Framework**
*Ch·ª•p narrative structure: Problem ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Proof ‚Üí Call to Action*

#### **Story Development Workshop:**

**Step 1: Problem Narrative (3 ph√∫t)**
```markdown
Story Opening - Current State Pain:

"Last month, our deployment took 6 hours v√† caused 45 minutes 
of downtime during peak dinner hours. We lost approximately 
$3,750 in revenue v√† received 47 customer complaints. 

This isn't an isolated incident - it's our reality every two weeks. 
Our manual deployment process involves 4 team members working 
overtime, usually on weekends, manually coordinating the release 
of our 4 critical microservices.

The complexity is growing faster than our ability to manage it. 
As we expand to more restaurant locations, this approach becomes 
unsustainable v√† increasingly risky."

Key emotional triggers:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Customer impact (complaints, lost revenue)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Team impact (weekend work, stress)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Business impact (scalability constraints)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Risk escalation (growing complexity)
```

**Step 2: Solution Narrative (4 ph√∫t)**
```markdown
Solution Story - Transformation Vision:

"Imagine triggering a deployment at 2 PM on a Tuesday. Within 
6 minutes, all 4 microservices are updated, health-checked, 
v√† running smoothly. No weekend work. No downtime. No stress.

Our AWS-powered solution orchestrates the entire process 
automatically. If anything goes wrong, the system detects it 
immediately v√† rolls back to the previous version within 2 minutes. 
The development team receives notifications throughout the process 
v√† can monitor progress in real-time.

This isn't just automation - it's transformation. We're moving 
from reactive firefighting to proactive orchestration. From 
manual coordination to intelligent automation. From deployment 
fear to deployment confidence."

Transformation benefits:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Operational efficiency (6 minutes vs 4 hours)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Risk reduction (automatic rollback)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Team satisfaction (no weekend work)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Business enablement (faster innovation)
```

**Step 3: Proof Points Development (3 ph√∫t)**
```markdown
Credibility Anchors:

Technical Proof:
"We've built v√† tested a working prototype that demonstrates 
core functionality. The AWS services we're using are enterprise-proven, 
with 99.99% availability SLAs. Companies like Netflix, Airbnb, 
v√† Capital One use similar architectures for mission-critical deployments."

Financial Proof:
"Our calculations are based on actual historical data from the 
last 12 months. We've tracked deployment times, incident counts, 
v√† resource allocation. The projected savings of $194K annually 
are conservative estimates based on documented inefficiencies."

Risk Mitigation Proof:
"We've identified v√† planned mitigation for all major risks. 
Our implementation approach is phased, allowing us to validate 
each component before full deployment. We have fallback procedures 
v√† can revert to manual processes if needed."
```

**Step 4: Call to Action Crafting (2 ph√∫t)**
```markdown
Decision Request - Clear v√† Compelling:

"We're requesting approval for a $45K investment that will:
- Save $194K annually starting in month 3
- Eliminate deployment-related customer impact
- Enable faster innovation cycles
- Position us for scalable growth

The ROI is exceptional - 1,132% over 3 years. The risk is minimal 
with our phased approach v√† proven technologies. The opportunity 
cost of delay is $16K per month in continued inefficiencies.

We can start next Monday with your approval today."

Decision Elements:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Specific investment amount
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Clear benefits summary

*Ch·ª•p table v·ªõi likely questions, answers, v√† supporting data*

```markdown
Common Executive Questions v√† Prepared Responses:

Q: "What if AWS has an outage?"
A: "We've planned for this v·ªõi multi-region capabilities v√† 
fallback procedures. AWS maintains 99.99% availability SLA. 
In the unlikely event of an outage, we can revert to manual 
processes v·ªõi documented procedures."

Q: "Why not use existing tools like Jenkins?"
A: "We evaluated Jenkins v√† other alternatives. AWS Step Functions 
provides better visual representation, built-in error handling, 
v√† tighter AWS integration. Our analysis shows 40% lower 
total cost of ownership compared to Jenkins infrastructure."

Q: "How do we know the cost projections are accurate?"
A: "All calculations are based on 12 months of historical data. 
We've documented every deployment, tracked all incidents, v√† 
measured actual resource consumption. We're using conservative 
estimates - actual savings may be higher."

Q: "What's the biggest risk?"
A: "The biggest risk is team learning curve, which we're 
mitigating v·ªõi comprehensive training v√† phased implementation. 
Technical risks are minimal given AWS's proven reliability 
v√† our prototype validation."

Q: "When will we see benefits?"
A: "Benefits begin immediately with reduced weekend deployments. 
Full financial benefits start in month 3 after complete 
implementation. Break-even occurs in month 2.3."

Q: "Can we start smaller?"
A: "Yes, our phased approach allows starting v·ªõi one microservice 
to validate the concept. However, full benefits require 
complete implementation. Partial implementation still delivers 
60% of projected savings."

Preparation Strategy:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Have supporting data ready for each answer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Practice concise 30-second responses
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Prepare follow-up technical details
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Know when to defer to appendix materials
