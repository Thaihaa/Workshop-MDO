- **Poor Visibility**: No real-time monitoring or rollback capability

### **Proposed Solution Value Proposition**
- **Automation**: Reduce deployment time from 4 hours to 6 minutes (98% improvement)
- **Zero Downtime**: Rolling deployments v·ªõi automatic rollback
- **Scalability**: Support 100+ restaurant locations simultaneously  
- **Cost Savings**: $240,000 annually in operational efficiency
- **Risk Reduction**: 95% reduction in deployment-related incidents
