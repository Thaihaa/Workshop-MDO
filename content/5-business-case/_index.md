## Cost-Benefit Analysis Workshop (20 phút)

**📸 IMAGE NEEDED: Financial Analysis Spreadsheet Template**
*Chụp Excel template với formulas và calculation areas*

### Current State Cost Analysis (8 phút)

#### Step 1: Direct Labor Costs (3 phút)
```markdown
Workshop Exercise: Calculate current deployment costs

Deployment Team:
- Senior Developer: $75/hour × 4 hours = $300 per deployment
- DevOps Engineer: $85/hour × 4 hours = $340 per deployment  
- QA Engineer: $60/hour × 2 hours = $120 per deployment
- Operations Manager: $90/hour × 1 hour = $90 per deployment

Per Deployment Cost: $850
Annual Deployments: 26 (bi-weekly)
Annual Labor Cost: $850 × 26 = $22,100

Weekend Premium (50% of deployments):
$22,100 × 0.5 × 1.5 = $16,575

Total Annual Labor: $22,100 + $16,575 = $38,675
```

#### Step 2: Opportunity Cost Analysis (3 phút)
```markdown
Lost Productivity During Deployments:

Development Team Impact:
- 3 developers blocked for 2 hours during deployment
- $75/hour × 3 developers × 2 hours × 26 deployments = $11,700

Customer Impact:
- Average 30 minutes downtime per deployment
- Revenue impact: $5,000/hour × 0.5 hours × 26 = $65,000
- Customer service calls: 50 calls × $25/call × 26 = $32,500

Total Opportunity Cost: $109,200
```

#### Step 3: Incident Resolution Costs (2 phút)
```markdown
Deployment-Related Incidents:

Historical Data (last 12 months):
- Total incidents: 15
- Average resolution time: 6 hours
- Team involved: 4 people × $75/hour average
- Incident cost: 15 × 6 × 4 × $75 = $27,000

Customer compensation:
- Service credits: $5,000
- Lost business: $15,000

Total Incident Cost: $47,000
```

### Proposed Solution Cost Analysis (7 phút)

#### Step 4: AWS Service Costs (3 phút)
```markdown
Monthly AWS Costs:

Step Functions:
- 26 executions × 6 state transitions × $0.025/1000 = $0.04
- Annual: $0.48

Lambda:
- 26 executions × 4 functions × 30 seconds × $0.0000166667 = $0.13
- Annual: $1.56

CloudWatch Logs:
- 26 executions × 100MB logs × $0.50/GB = $1.30
- Annual: $15.60

SNS Notifications:
- 26 executions × 5 notifications × $0.50/1000 = $0.065
- Annual: $0.78

Total AWS Annual Cost: $18.42 ≈ $20
```

#### Step 5: Reduced Labor Costs (2 phút)
```markdown
Automated Process Labor:

Monitoring Role:
- DevOps Engineer: $85/hour × 0.5 hours × 26 = $1,105
- On-call premium: $1,105 × 0.25 = $276

Total Annual Labor: $1,381

Labor Savings: $38,675 - $1,381 = $37,294
```

#### Step 6: Implementation Costs (2 phút)
```markdown
One-time Implementation:

Development Team:
- Senior Developer: 200 hours × $75 = $15,000
- DevOps Engineer: 150 hours × $85 = $12,750
- Architect: 40 hours × $120 = $4,800

AWS Professional Services:
- Architecture review: $5,000
- Security assessment: $3,000

Training và Documentation:
- Team training: $2,500
- Documentation: $1,500

Total Implementation: $44,550
```
