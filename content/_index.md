## Overview

**üì∏ IMAGE NEEDED: Cover Slide v·ªõi Logo v√† Title**
*Ch·ª•p slide ƒë·∫ßu ti√™n v·ªõi title "Restaurant Microservices Deployment Orchestration System Proposal" v√† company logo*

Workshop n√†y s·∫Ω h∆∞·ªõng d·∫´n b·∫°n c√°ch x√¢y d·ª±ng m·ªôt **Technology Proposal** ho√†n ch·ªânh cho h·ªá th·ªëng t·ª± ƒë·ªông h√≥a deployment microservices trong doanh nghi·ªáp. B·∫°n s·∫Ω h·ªçc c√°ch ph√¢n t√≠ch requirements, thi·∫øt k·∫ø solution architecture, implement prototype, v√† present convincing business case.

## Workshop Learning Objectives

Sau khi ho√†n th√†nh workshop n√†y, b·∫°n s·∫Ω c√≥ th·ªÉ:

### **Proposal Development Skills**
‚Ä¢ **Requirements Analysis**: Thu th·∫≠p v√† ph√¢n t√≠ch business requirements t·ª´ stakeholders  
‚Ä¢ **Solution Architecture**: Thi·∫øt k·∫ø comprehensive technical solution v·ªõi AWS services  
‚Ä¢ **Business Case Building**: T√≠nh to√°n ROI, cost-benefit analysis, v√† risk assessment  
‚Ä¢ **Technical Presentation**: Present compelling proposal v·ªõi executive summary v√† technical deep-dive  

### **Technical Implementation Skills**
‚Ä¢ **Prototype Development**: X√¢y d·ª±ng working prototype ƒë·ªÉ demonstrate feasibility  
‚Ä¢ **Cost Estimation**: AWS cost modeling v√† pricing strategy  
‚Ä¢ **Timeline Planning**: Project roadmap v·ªõi milestones v√† deliverables  
‚Ä¢ **Risk Mitigation**: Identify v√† address potential implementation challenges  

## Business Case Context

**üì∏ IMAGE NEEDED: Current State vs Future State Comparison**
*Ch·ª•p slide comparison showing:*
- *Current manual process v·ªõi timeline v√† bottlenecks*
- *Proposed automated solution v·ªõi improved metrics*

### **Restaurant Chain "Golden Lotus" - Current Challenges**
- **Manual Deployment Process**: 3-4 hours per release, high error rate
- **Service Dependencies**: Complex coordination between 4 microservices
- **Downtime Issues**: 15-30 minutes downtime per deployment  
- **Limited Scalability**: Cannot handle multiple restaurant locations efficiently
- **Poor Visibility**: No real-time monitoring or rollback capability

### **Proposed Solution Value Proposition**
- **Automation**: Reduce deployment time from 4 hours to 6 minutes (98% improvement)
- **Zero Downtime**: Rolling deployments v·ªõi automatic rollback
- **Scalability**: Support 100+ restaurant locations simultaneously  
- **Cost Savings**: $240,000 annually in operational efficiency
- **Risk Reduction**: 95% reduction in deployment-related incidents
